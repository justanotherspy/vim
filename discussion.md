I'll help you create a solid minimalist vim configuration that works on both macOS and Ubuntu! Let me explain the basics and then create a configuration file for you.

## Vim Configuration Basics

**Key files and directories:**
- `~/.vimrc` - Main configuration file (or `~/.vim/vimrc`)
- `~/.vim/` - Directory for vim-related files
  - `~/.vim/backup/` - For backup files
  - `~/.vim/swap/` - For swap files
  - `~/.vim/undo/` - For persistent undo history
  - `~/.vim/colors/` - Custom color schemes
  - `~/.vim/plugin/` - Plugin files (if not using a plugin manager)

**Essential settings for a good minimalist config:**
- **Usability**: Line numbers, mouse support, better search
- **Editing**: Smart indentation, syntax highlighting
- **Performance**: Reasonable defaults without bloat
- **Compatibility**: Works across vim versions and platforms

Let me create a well-commented, minimalist `.vimrc` for you:Perfect! I've created a comprehensive minimalist vim configuration for you. Here's what it includes:

## Key Features

**Display & Navigation:**
- Line numbers (both absolute and relative)
- Mouse support in all modes
- Highlighted current line
- Smooth scrolling with buffer zones

**Smart Editing:**
- 4-space indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Auto-indenting and smart indenting
- Syntax highlighting
- Search as you type with highlighting

**File Management:**
- Automatic backup, swap, and undo files (organized in `~/.vim/` subdirectories)
- Persistent undo history across sessions
- Auto-reload files changed externally

**Handy Key Mappings:**
- `Space` as leader key
- `Space + h` - Clear search highlights
- `Space + w` - Quick save
- `Ctrl + h/j/k/l` - Navigate between splits
- `< >` in visual mode - Indent while keeping selection

## Installation

**On both macOS and Ubuntu:**

```bash
# Copy the config to your home directory
cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc

# Create the necessary directories (they'll be auto-created, but you can do it manually too)
mkdir -p ~/.vim/{backup,swap,undo}

# You're ready to use it!
vim
```

**For clipboard support:**
- **macOS**: Works out of the box
- **Ubuntu**: Install `vim-gtk3` for clipboard support:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install vim-gtk3
  ```

## Customization

The config includes a hook for local customizations. Create `~/.vimrc.local` for machine-specific settings that won't be overwritten if you sync your `.vimrc` across machines.

This configuration is compatible with Vim 9.1 and will work great on both platforms!
